Integrate Lansweeper with CI Sync to automate data synchronization from IT, OT, and IoT assets into your ServiceNow CMDB.  
This integration ensures your CMDB remains accurate and continuously updated, helping improve IT operations, compliance, and risk management.

CI Sync is a turnkey solution that connects Lansweeper and ServiceNow, enabling organizations to achieve CMDB automation in days rather than months. It delivers reliable configuration item (CI) synchronization supported by enterprise-grade scalability, security, and data privacy controls.

Delivered as a Software‑as‑a‑Service (SaaS) solution, each CI Sync instance is hosted per customer in a chosen region and enrolled as an Enterprise Application in Azure Active Directory. This architecture supports security, data sovereignty, and rapid deployment.  

CI Sync provides a simple user interface to define synchronization jobs, monitor results, and manage notifications. It supports both delta synchronization and full record re-synchronization, dynamically scaling to handle hundreds of thousands of records per hour to keep your CMDB refreshed daily.

## Use Cases

- Automate Lansweeper asset data synchronization into ServiceNow CMDB.  
- Establish accurate relationships between configuration items (CIs).  
- Keep ServiceNow records continuously aligned with Lansweeper asset discovery.  
- Reduce compliance, cyber, and operational risk through accurate, timely data.  

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following requirements are met:

- Active **Lansweeper Site** with Marketplace access.  
- Configured **ServiceNow CMDB** instance.  
- **Azure Active Directory integration** for authentication when scheduling synchronization jobs and reviewing logs.
